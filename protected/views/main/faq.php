<h1>LoL Namecheck F.A.Q.</h1>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="question">What is LoL Namecheck?</p>
  <p class="answer">LoL Namecheck is a tool that allows users to find out when a League of Legends username is available according to <a href="https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up">this</a> article.</p>

  <p class="question">What is <a href="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/upcoming">upcoming names</a>?</p>
  <p class="answer"><a href="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/upcoming">Upcoming names</a> is a list of usernames that are expiring soon. It shows names up to 2 weeks in advance. This is not the full list of all usernames in League of Legends, but has most OG names</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">How do you get the names on the <a href="http://twitter.com/LoLNamecheck">@LoLNamecheck</a> Twitter account?</p>
  <p class="answer">These names are names that users have switched out of and have become available. These usernames do not exist, so you can take these usernames on brand new level 1 accounts as well as through the store. I get these names by running a script that goes through all usernames and finds out which do not exist anymore. </p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">Can I take usernames on a fresh account?</p>
  <p class="answer">You can only take usernames on a fresh account if they do not currently exist. For usernames that are expiring, you need to buy the name change in the League of Legends store. Take a look at <a href="https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up">this article</a> for clarification.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">Are the expiring dates exact?</p>
  <p class="answer">While most are correct, the dates are approximate. Some older names do not have a match history anymore, and needs to be calculated using other sets of data from the Riot API, but may not be accurate. I found that most names are on point or become available within 1-2 days of the listed expiry date.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">What time does the name become available?</p>
  <p class="answer">I've tested this for a while, and it looks like Riot does not have an exact time that they free the names. Riot seems to release the names in multiple batches throughout the day. It is advised to search for the name once in a while on the day that the name becomes available in order to secure the name. </p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">Are the timezones adjusted to where I am?</p>
  <p class="answer">Currently, no. All the times are currently calculated in PST. This might change in a future update to the website. </p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">I want a name on the <a href="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/upcoming">upcoming usernames</a> list. Can you take the name off the list for me?</p>
  <p class="answer">No.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="question">Who are you?</p>
  <p class="answer">I'm Koggiri, an engineering student from Canada. My LoL username is "Plant" on the NA server. For future updates, like my page on <a href="http://facebook.com/JHM.JJ">Facebook</a> or follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/koggiri">Twitter</a>.
